pickl simply takes a file as an argument and picks a line:

Execute by : `pickl [-f FILENAME] [-n ITERATIONS]`


	**-f FILENAME**		Read from FILENAME instead of stdin

	**-n ITERATIONS**	Print ITERATIONS random lines, instead of just one

## Planned updates:
- Range within file (limited to the size of the file)
- Pick a (non binary) file to pick a line from
- Request a number of lines
- Interactively y/n the line to exit/generate a new one
